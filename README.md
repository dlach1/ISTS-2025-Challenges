# ISTS-2025-Challenges
For the security competition Information Security Talent Search (ISTS) I created 5 hardware/wireless challenges. They have approximate difficulties:
### Easy
1. **Cycle Conspiracy**
    Basic part identification challenge where competitors are requested to find the clock pin on an FPGA.
2. **Secret Signals**
    Basic wireless challenge where competitors get more comfortable with the spectrograph.
### Medium
3. **Gate Gambit**
    Hardware challenge with circuit diagramming and ASCII encoding
4. **Vault_0xff**
    Hardware challenge with morse code encoding and state machines.
### Hard
5. **Handshake Havoc**
    WiFi challenge where competitors are given a packet capture with a WiFi handshake and need to find a way onto the network.
